\section{Introduction}

Software systems increasingly outsource parts of application logic to first- or third-party \emph{dependencies} --- pieces of code that are used in conjunction or as a part of the application's business logic but that are not part of the application itself. \needsRef

Keeping track of dependencies can be an arduous task, which can be more easily managed using software tools and components such as \emph{package managers} that keep track of an application's dependencies and their versions \needsRef, like \emph{npm} or \emph{cargo} \cite{tools:pkg-mngr:npm,tools:pkg-mngr:cargo}.
