\section{Introduction}

Software systems, now more than ever, outsource parts of application logic to first- or third-party \emph{dependencies} --- pieces of code that are used in conjunction or as a part of the application's business logic but that are not part of the application itself.

Keeping track of dependencies can be an arduous task, which can be more easily managed using software tools and components such as \emph{package managers} that keep track of an application's dependencies and their versions \cite{article:package-manager}, like \emph{npm} or \emph{cargo} \cite{tools:pkg-mngr:npm,tools:pkg-mngr:cargo}.

SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials) \cite{article:concept:sbom-2}, proposed by the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), are a formal way of describing the software dependencies of an application and the relations between these dependencies. Other metadata can be attached to SBOM entries for a more comprehensive outline of the software components being dependended upon.

Currently, there are 3 SBOM standards used in practice: OWASP CycloneDX \cite{standards:sbom:cyclonedx}, Software Product Data eXchange (SPDX) \cite{standards:sbom:spdx} and Software Identification Tagging (SWID) \cite{standards:sbom:swid}. However, little consensus exists between these 3 standards, making for one of the many challenges against general SBOM adoption \cite{article:sbom-study}.

To ensure widespread practice of SBOM, potential challenges and their solutions must be known and categorized beforehand in order to mitigate issues during development that might arise from a lack of understanding of the software components that make up a product. However, since the topic of SBOMs is still relatively new, there is not much research made into the topic that provide for a standardized view of the common practices in place, and thus further work is required.
