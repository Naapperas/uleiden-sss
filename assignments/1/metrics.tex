\section{Metrics defined} \label{metrics}

In order to critically compare the reviewed papers, some metrics need to be used that can objectively rank these papers with respect to the metrics themselves.

Since SBOM is a relatively novel concept, comparing literature on this topic should focus on finding out and exposing the most common challenges pertaining to SBOM widespread adoption and how those can be mitigated. Other interesting aspects relevant for SBOM adoption is how generalized these problems are, since problems that are too specific to a certain domain only provide value for that domain and cannot be reused in other contexts.

As such, the metrics we have devised for our critical comparison of the papers we reviewed are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Number of SBOM adoption challenges} The number of challenges an organization or system integrator needs to face before extracting value out of the use of SBOMs directly correlates to how eager they might be to adopting SBOMs in their processes: if the benefits don't outweigh the challenges, it is not valuable, and thus not desirable, to put in the effort required to correctly adopt and practice SBOM development.
    \item \textbf{TBD}
    \item \textbf{TBD}
    \item \textbf{How common the challenges might be between populations studied between different research papers}
\end{enumerate}

% quality results -
% methodological soundness -

Although we believe these metrics to be valid comparison points between the papers discussed, there are some issues which could hinder the validity of the comparisons made with them, which we will discuss in section [INSERT SECTION HERE].
