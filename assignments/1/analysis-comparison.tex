\section{Analysis and Comparison of reviewed papers} \label{analysis}

\noindent With a set of relevant metrics defined for the topic of SBOMs, we analyzed and compared the papers based on these criteria. Our findings are summarized in Table 1.

\paragraph{Xia et al. \cite{article:sbom-study}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The aims of this study are clearly defined when defining the research questions, and the potential (and effective) contributions of the study reflect this. (5/5)
    \item Since the survey data was compared against interview results and conclusions were drawn from analyzing both, we are confident in their validity. The link between research questions and conclusions is logically sound, so this paper scores a 5 on this metric. (5/5)
    \item Lack of standard format extensibility, potential for attackers to use SBOMs as an attack "guide" or lack of SBOM education by industry professionals are identified as the 3 main concerns analyzed. (3)
    \item %% TODO: catalog challenges to calculate frequencies
    \item The defined 3-goal model outlines steps that the authors believe are crucial to practice if SBOMs are to see more widespread adoption. (3)
    \item The study included 82 participants from diverse backgrounds and countries. Most expertise categories have over 10 participants, with some exceptions, such as Researchers. However, each Researcher has at least 10 years of experience in software engineering, making their assessments highly representative (4/5).
    \item The data analysis methods used for both the interviews' and online surveys' responses are backed by literature articles, so they are easily reproducible. (5/5)
    \item %% TODO: uhhh
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Bi et al. \cite{article:sboms-issues-solutions}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    \item
    \item The paper identifies three categories of SBOM issues, with the second and third categories further divided into subcategories, resulting in a total of eight distinct SBOM issues. Notably, issues are reported as percentages, while solutions are presented as measurable counts. Despite these differing metrics, we believe the reviewed papers can still be compared effectively as is. (8)
    \item
    \item The authors explicitly state that they found "33 high-level solutions for the SBOM-relevant issues and their main design problem". It can be argued whether these are actual solutions or steps towards solutions but we will respect the author's own assessment. (33)
