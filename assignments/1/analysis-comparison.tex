\section{Analysis and Comparison of reviewed papers} \label{analysis}

\noindent With a set of relevant metrics defined for the topic of SBOMs, we analyzed and compared the papers based on these criteria. Our findings are summarized in Table 1.

\paragraph{Xia et al. \cite{article:sbom-study}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The aims of this study are clearly defined when defining the research questions, and the potential (and effective) contributions of the study reflect this. (5/5)
    \item Since the survey data was compared against interview results and conclusions were drawn from analyzing both, we are confident in their validity. The link between research questions and conclusions is logically sound, so this paper scores a 5 on this metric. (5/5)
    \item Lack of standard format extensibility, potential for attackers to use SBOMs as an attack "guide" or lack of SBOM education by industry professionals are identified as the 3 main concerns analyzed. (3)
    \item
    \item The defined 3-goal model outlines steps that the authors believe are crucial to practice if SBOMs are to see more widespread adoption. (3)
    \item Overall, the study counted on 82 participants, from several backgrounds and countries. Counting the number of individuals per expertise category, there are generally more than 10 participants in each category. Exceptions exists, such as the case with \emph{Researchers}, but every participant that falls under this category has at least 10 years of experience in the field of S.E., so we still find their assessments considerably representative (4/5).
    \item The data analysis methods used for both the interviews' and online surveys' responses are backed by literature articles, so they are easily reproducible. (5/5)
    \item
\end{enumerate}
