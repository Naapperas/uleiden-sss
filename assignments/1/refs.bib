  abstract  = {Organizations are increasingly reliant on third-party software products to expedite their own development cycles, often incorporating numerous components into their end systems, resulting in a lack of transparency in software dependencies. Malicious actors exploit this, leading to Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks with substantial economic and security damages. To mitigate this threat, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) concept was introduced. It details software components and their supply chain relationships, thus enhancing SSC transparency. Unfortunately, SBOM adoption still remains limited. While previous studies identified some reasons behind this, they overlooked the perspectives of different business stakeholder groups involved in SBOM's lifecycle.In this work, we address this gap by studying business stakeholder groups directly involved in SBOM production and consumption. The main goal of this work is to identify which groups can drive or inhibit SBOM adoption and the rationale behind this behavior. By conducting interviews with the group representatives, we identified stakeholder-specific risks, benefits, concerns and incentives regarding SBOM adoption. Our analysis suggests that SBOM adoption potential is higher among System Integrators and Software Vendors. At the same time, B2B customers and Individual Developers have the least motivation, inhibiting the process of SBOM adoption. Given that these are the main SBOM consuming and supplying stakeholders correspondingly, we conclude that the overall adoption potential of this technology is currently limited and requires considerable external impulse.},

  abstract  = {Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have emerged as tools to facilitate the management of software dependencies, vulnerabilities, licenses, and the supply chain. While significant effort has been devoted to increasing SBOM awareness and developing SBOM formats and tools, recent studies have shown that SBOMs are still an early technology not yet adequately adopted in practice. Expanding on previous research, this paper reports a comprehensive study that investigates the current challenges stakeholders encounter when creating and using SBOMs. The study surveyed 138 practitioners belonging to five stakeholder groups (practitioners familiar with SBOMs, members of critical open source projects, AI/ML, cyberphysical systems, and legal practitioners) using differentiated questionnaires, and interviewed 8 survey respondents to gather further insights about their experience. We identified 12 major challenges facing the creation and use of SBOMs, including those related to the SBOM content, deficiencies in SBOM tools, SBOM maintenance and verification, and domain-specific challenges. We propose and discuss 4 actionable solutions to the identified challenges and present the major avenues for future research and development.},

  abstract   = {The increase of software supply chain threats has underscored the necessity for robust security mechanisms, among which the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) stands out as a promising solution. SBOMs, by providing a machine-readable inventory of software composition details, play a crucial role in enhancing transparency and traceability within software supply chains. This empirical study delves into the practical challenges and solutions associated with the adoption of SBOMs through an analysis of 4,786 GitHub discussions across 510 SBOM-related projects. Through repository mining and analysis, this research delineates key topics, challenges, and solutions intrinsic to the effective utilization of SBOMs. Furthermore, we shed light on commonly used tools and frameworks for SBOM generation, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. This study underscores a set of findings, for example, there are four phases of the SBOM life cycle, and each phase has a set of SBOM development activities and issues; in addition, this study emphasizes the role SBOM play in ensuring resilient software development practices and the imperative of their widespread adoption and integration to bolster supply chain security. The insights of our study provide vital input for future work and practical advancements in this topic.},
