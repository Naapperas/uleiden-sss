Supply Chain Security is an increasingly important factor of modern Software Development. Ensuring that companies adopt good practices in regards to the code they outsource is a pivotal step in ensuring the security requirements of software products. SBOMs \cite{article:concept:sbom-2} are an example of such a practice that promotes good secure software engineering practices.

In this paper, we analyzed N examples of the state-of-the-art with regards to SBOMs and conducted a critical review of these papers according to our own metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Metric 1
    \item Metric 2
    \item ...
