\section{Conclusion}

\\ The standard that nowadays has the most critical aspects in usage is SWID, as testified by our unsuccessful attempts to generate SWID tags and the lack of variety in tools available for this purpose. This is a clear indicator that this standard is not as widely adopted as the others, as also shown in this previous research \cite{article:software-bom}. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, as SWID is a useful standard for software identification and its usage should be encouraged by making it easier to generate the tags.
